It is implemented as a Firefox extension, and allows you to record, edit, and debug tests. Selenium IDE includes the entire Selenium Core, allowing you to easily and quickly record and play back tests in the actual environment that they will run.\n\nNote: Selenium IDE will NOT work on Firefox version 55 onwards. Please stay on Firefox version 54 or older. To keep yourself secure, install a separate older version of Firefox just for automated testing using portable Firefox or similar and install Selenium IDE there. Firefox will no longer support the core technologies that addons like Selenium IDE are based on. See https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2016/11/23/add-ons-in-2017/ for more information. It is going to take a lot of time and hard work to make make Selenium IDE compatible and we are working hard on it. If you feel like it, tell Mozilla directly that you would like Firefox to support addons like Selenium IDE.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/6/6640.png?src=api&modified=1332774819","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/6/6640.png?src=api&modified=1332774819"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/6/6641.png?src=api&modified=1332774819","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/6/6641.png?src=api&modified=1332774819"}],"averageRating":4,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/selenium-ide/?src=api","homepageURL":"http://seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/303844/selenium_ide-2.9.1-fx.xpi?src=api","size":815598,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/selenium-ide/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":149,"totalDownloads":2588420,"weeklyDownloads":11227,"dailyUsers":93557,"updateDate":1443192522000,"supportURL":"http://groups.google.com/group/selenium-users"}]}
